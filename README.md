Do you find yourself wasting valuable time 
* handling your data
* analysing it
* or doing statistics?

Do you want to spend your time on
* understanding results
* generating revenues?

We are a group of young, talented scientists working on a solution!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We have already proven ourselves valuable to four leading research groups in life-sciences at the University of Edinburgh. Thanks to our support they improved speed and quality of their scientific work and they all expressed their willingness to continue collaborating with us. 

This experience gave us confidence that we can enhance your productivity in the same fashion. Currently we are devising a business model to help potential customers like you do the tedious tasks automated, quickly and accurately.

Please take a minute to fill in the questionnaire to help us better understand your problems. 

We are currently engaged in a startup generation workshop. If you are willing to share some of insightful ideas, we would be delighted to discuss with you.
